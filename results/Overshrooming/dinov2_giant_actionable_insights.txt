💡 CONFUSION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS:
   📋 ACTION ITEMS:
      1. Manually inspect the misclassified examples listed above
      2. Compare misclassified examples with typical examples of both classes
      3. Look for visual patterns in misclassified images
      4. Check if confused species share morphological features
      5. Verify ground truth labels for high-confidence errors
      6. Consider collecting more diverse samples for confused classes

   🔍 INSPECTION TIPS:
      - Pay special attention to high-confidence errors (>0.8)
      - Compare misclassified images with typical examples of each class
      - Look for systematic differences in image conditions or angles
      - Check if images were taken in similar environments/conditions
      - Look for image quality issues (blur, lighting, angle)
      - Verify taxonomic relationships between confused species

⚠️  PROBLEMATIC CLASSES (46 classes need attention):

   📊 DATA SCARCITY (46 classes):
      - 36: only 5 samples
      - 41: only 8 samples
      - 59: only 5 samples
   💡 Solution: Collect more data, use data augmentation, consider class weights

🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. 🟢 Good accuracy - Focus on fine-tuning
      - Address remaining confusion pairs
      - Implement confidence-based rejection
      - Consider ensemble methods
   2. 📊 Data improvements:
      - Collect more samples for rare classes
      - Review and clean mislabeled samples
      - Add more diverse augmentations
   3. 🔧 Model improvements:
      - Experiment with different classifier head depths
      - Try different image resolutions
      - Consider hierarchical classification for related species
